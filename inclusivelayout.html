                <h1>Inclusive<em> and <br>Exclusive</em> Design</h1>
                <h6>Beyond Aesthetics, embracing Inclusive Design in the Digital Era</h6>

                 <h2>Embrace Digital Transformation</h2>

                 <p>In the past, the traditional impression of graphic designers in the business field focused on creating visually striking experiences, communicating ideas with consumers, and generating further business actions. In recent years, as smartphones became the mainstream design medium, many graphic designers transitioned into digital product designers to stay competitive. However, beyond the traditional realm of graphic design, inclusive design thinking has become an indispensable key in the field of product design.</p>

                 <h2>The Essence of Inclusive Design</h2>

                 <p>Inclusive Design aims to create universally usable products, considering factors like age, gender, and physical abilities. For example, user-friendly websites illustrate Inclusive Design principles, fostering a more welcoming online experience. Despite potential limits on creativity, Inclusive Design is essential for fostering a universal society, enabling people of different backgrounds to use products freely. This is particularly crucial in interface design, where creating a user-friendly experience for everyone is paramount.</p>

                 <h2> Inclusive Design Guidelines</h2>

                 <p>In reality, to enable developers to create more inclusive designs, many large enterprises release design guidelines. These guidelines facilitate efficient product development, ensuring products meet user needs. While some criticize the increasing uniformity in digital products driven by inclusive design, it streamlines development and enhances cross-cultural deployment, crucial considerations for product designers.</p>

                 <h2>Crucial Element in Digital Product Design</h2>

                 <p>In conclusion, inclusive design thinking is indispensable in digital product design. Even though it may limit design diversity in some aspects, it is a necessary trade-off. In the field of digital product design, rather than pursuing exclusive design, inclusive digital products can reach a broader audience, implementing their value in more people's lives. User benefits are the key to sustaining a product over time.</p>

                <h1><em>Inclusive and</em> Exclusive Design</h1>
                <h6>Rethink the value of exclusive design in the inclusive digital era</h6>

                 <h2>Inclusive & Exclusive Design Dynamics</h2>

                 <p>In the era where smartphones dominate as the mainstream design medium, inclusive design thinking has gained widespread acclaim for meeting the needs of the majority. However, with IOS and Android dominating the design landscape, the pursuit of accommodating everyone's habits has led digital products to converge, significantly limiting the creative space for designers. While the importance of inclusive thinking is undeniable, in my opinion, exclusive design still holds value in certain situations.</p>

                 <h2>Impact on Innovation and Sustainability</h2>

                 <p>Over the past decade, smartphones have become the primary medium, and many inclusive design principles have been documented as design guidelines, such as material and iOS guidelines. However, this has led organizations to excessively rely on design principles to improve efficiency within the organization, resulting in standardized and uninspired designs. Prolonged exposure to such environments may cause internal designers to lose their passion and motivation for innovation. Nevertheless, continuous innovation remains a core competency to sustain a designer's career.</p>

                 <h2>Exclusive Design's Appeal in Luxury Markets</h2>

                 <p>In fact, there is no doubt that it can be successful in certain area. Despite not serving the majority, it excels in niche markets. In the luxury industry, for example, Exclusive Design creates an exclusive feeling, cultivating a desire for a high-end lifestyle. Although not universally appealing, this approach can resonate with specific groups.</p>

                 <h2>Balancing Creativity for Broad User Appeal</h2>

                 <p>I believe that, in the digital product design realm, inclusive design is crucial and widely embraced. However, as design serves people with diverse needs, a good designer should tailor strategies based on users' needs and design purposes. Striking a balance between creativity and universality remains the primary challenge for today's designers. This balance is key to creating extraordinary designs that cater to a broad audience.</p>
